p:Wha...where am I?
n:OHHOHO!
n:The time travel agent final wakes up! Welcome to my lab!
p:Lab? What kind of lab has decor like this? It looks straight out of ancient Asia.
n:That's because we ARE in ancient Asia!
n:Your rewind device malfunctioned and sent you too far back, as did mine. 
p:Malfunctioned? It can't be...but these devices only take us backwards!
p:How am I going to get back to the present? What about my family?
n:FEAR NOT FOR I, ALFRED WAGNER, HAVE DEVISED A WAY TO RETURN TO THE PRESENT!
n:The answer is the machine behind you!
n:Through the use of certain relics I have found in this time period,
n:I have been building a device to take us back to the future! 
n:Unfortunately, some relics I need are protected by defenses which
n: I, a mere mad scientist, cannot overcome. 
n:Hmmm, but for a professional, like say, a time travel agent, *wink wink*
n:these defenses should be no trouble at all! What do you say?
p:...
p:I'll help. I need to get back, no matter what. 
n:PERFECT! You will find the first relic I need in the city!
p:Got it, I'll be right back. 
n:Also, make sure to pick up any yellow spirits you see along the way!
