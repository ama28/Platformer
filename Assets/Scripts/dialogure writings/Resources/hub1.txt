p:Wha...where am I?
n:OHHOHO!
n:The time travel agent final wakes up!
n:You are here, in my laboratory!
p:Laboratory?
p:What kind of lab has decor like this? It looks straight out of ancient Asia.
n:That's because we ARE in ancient Asia!
n:Your rewind device malfunctioned and sent you too far back, as did mine. 
p:Malfunctioned? It can't be...but these devices only take us backwards!
p:How am I going to get back to the present? What about my family?
n:DO NOT FEAR, young agent!
n:FOR I, ___ HAVE DEVISED A WAY TO RETURN TO THE PRESENT!
p:You've found a way? What is it? How do we get back?
n:HOHOH, a little bit of patience, traveler.
n:The answer is the machine behind you!
n:Through the use of certain relics I have found in this time period,
n:I have been building a device to take us back to the future! 
n:Unfortunately, it is still incomplete. Some of the relics I need are
n:protected by defenses, which I, a mere mad scientist, cannot overcome. 
n:Hmmm, but for a professional, like say, a time travel agent, *wink wink*
n:these defenses should be no trouble at all! What do you say?
p:...
p:I'll help. I need to get back, no matter what. 
n:PERFECT! There are two missing pieces that I require.
n:The first part is in the city! Bring it to me, and
n:I will tell you where to find the next part!
p:Got it, I'll be right back. 
n:Also, make sure to pick up any spare parts you see along the way!
