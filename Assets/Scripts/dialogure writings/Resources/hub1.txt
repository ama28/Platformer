p:Where...where am I?
n:OHHOHO!
n:You finally wake up.
n:You are here, in my hub!
p:Hub?
p:What's all this decoration style? It looks very ancient Asian.
n:YES! We are in acient asia!
n:I'm stuck here, just like you!
n:Nice to see you made the same stupid mistake just like me.
n:Rewinding to far back, huh?
n:And if you ever want to go back...
p:How do I go back?
n:HOHOH, a little bit of patience, traveler.
n:To go back, the only way is this time machine I am building!
n:It is just behind us.
p:Terrific! Can I use it?
n:I said I am still building it! 
n:But you must help me!
n:There are two missing pieces of the time machine hidden in this place.
n:One in the night city, the other in the shrine.
n:Once I aquire the pair, I can get the time machine fully working!
n:I promise we will get back together.
p:Okay...sounds doable.
n:Deal then!
n:I recommend you start with the night city.
